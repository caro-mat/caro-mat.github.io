## Project 1: Data Science Universities (ETL process)

This project provides an overview over all data science bachelor and masters programs. Data is collected about the programs and merged them with the schools world ranking. 

- scrape data about data science programs with python (response, beautifulsoup, pandas)
- scrape data about school rankings with python
- transform and merge data in tableau prep 
- write to sql database
- visualize in tableau
